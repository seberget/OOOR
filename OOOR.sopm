    <Description Lang="en">
Filters out e-mail responses to ticket updates that are out-of-office-replies. This is done by analyzing e-mail headers. All e-mails are received but they will not change the state of the ticket. An entry is created in _history_ to say which action was made, and which header was the deciding factor.

Make sure that the following headers are present in the _Core::Email::PostMaster_ _PostmasterX-Header_ section:
_X-Autoreply_, _X-Autorespond_, _X-Auto-Response-Suppress_, _Auto-Submitted_ and _Return-Path_. Case is important.
